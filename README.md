**Power BI • DAX • Custom Visuals**  
Where built-in charts stop short, I build what’s missing.

## 👋 Hi, I’m Neet

I work at the intersection of data, design, and logic — building dashboards that don’t just look good but **make sense fast**.

I’m a Business Intelligence developer who:

- 📊 Builds clean, functional dashboards in **Power BI**
- 🧮 Uses **DAX** to make reports smarter and more responsive
- 🎨 Designs **custom visuals** with Deneb and SVG when native charts aren’t enough
- 🧠 Focuses on user clarity — because people shouldn’t have to guess what a chart means

> *If a stakeholder has to ask what they’re looking at, it’s not a finished visual.*

## 🛠️ What I Believe

### 1. You don’t need a hundred tools — just the right ones  
I mostly work with:
- Power BI  
- Deneb (Vega-Lite)  
- Simple SVG logic  
That’s usually enough to make 90% of visuals clean, branded, interactive — and more useful than the default templates.

### 2. Good design = empathy  
Most charts are too complicated. My work is about removing friction — giving people answers faster, with less noise. Especially for non-technical audiences.

### 3. AI is fast. Taste is faster.  
Yes, tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot can generate dashboards. But they can’t make judgment calls. They can’t design with empathy. That’s where I come in.

## 🎯 How I Level Up

Here’s my visual design stack, in order:

1. **Power BI** — clean dashboards and native visuals  
2. **DAX** — smart calculations, filters, KPIs  
3. **Deneb** — custom visuals using Vega-Lite  
4. **D3.js** — full control when I want to push the limits (or monetize)
