**Power BI • DAX • Custom Visuals**  
Where built-in charts stop short, I build what’s missing.

---

## 👋 Hi, I’m Neet

I design with data — and build what’s missing when the defaults fall short.

I’ve worked across industries: **finance, revenue management in hospitality, IT consulting, and eCommerce digital tech**. That range taught me how differently teams use data — and how often dashboards miss the mark. My focus is on creating tools people can actually use — quickly, clearly, and without needing a walkthrough.

By background, I’m a **Business Intelligence developer** with a strong foundation in **Power BI and DAX**. But I’m also a **data scientist at heart**, with a deep interest in the logic behind what we measure and why.

Lately, I’ve been getting into **data engineering with Microsoft Fabric** — learning humbly, but intentionally. I’m aiming to understand and support the full data pipeline — from raw ingestion to visual insight — and quietly becoming the kind of person who can bridge those gaps end-to-end.

What I build is shaped by these ideas:

- 📊 Use Power BI for clarity — not clutter  
- 🧮 Let DAX do the heavy lifting behind the scenes  
- 🎨 Build custom visuals with Deneb when native charts can’t tell the full story  
- 🧠 Focus on cognitive simplicity — because if it takes more than 3 seconds to understand, it needs another pass

> I don’t want to master every tool. I want to master the experience — for the person on the other side of the dashboard.

This space is where I explore that work, piece by piece.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

### 🎯 Visual Simplicity with Maximum Impact

You don’t need every tool in the stack. Just:

- Power BI  
- Deneb (Vega-Lite)  
- Simple SVG logic  

That’s often 90% of what it takes to create branded, interactive, low-friction dashboards.

### 🤖 Staying Relevant in an AI-First World

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot can auto-generate charts and reports.  
But what they can’t replicate is:

- **Simple & Sophisticated**
- **Empathy**
- **User-first design approach**
- **Very Useful and Bang on Visuals that drive High Impact Business Decisions**

I design for human interpretation — not just machine output.

## 🧭 My Learning Path

1. **Power BI** — build clean dashboards and reports  
2. **DAX** — write logic that responds to context and goals  
3. **Deneb** — go custom when native visuals aren’t cutting it  
4. **D3.js** — deep customization and full visual control for edge cases (or monetization)
