**Power BI • DAX • Custom Visuals • Python • Machine Learning • Fabric**  

## 👋 Hi, I’m Neet

              - 🧠 **More than a Business Intelligence Developer.**  
              - 📊 **More than a Data Scientist.**  
              - 🎨 I design visuals that make complex data instantly clear — even to C-levels with zero time.  
              - 💡 If it needs an extensive walkthrough, it’s not done yet...!

 ***BASICALLY: I’m a BI–Data Science hybrid, now also stepping into data engineering with Fabric — learning humbly, trying to cover the entire data pipeline in one person: ME!***

I’ve worked across industries — **finance**, **revenue management in hospitality**, **IT consulting**, and **eCommerce digital tech**.
Along the way, I’ve been observing how different teams use data — and how often dashboards **miss the mark**.

My focus is on building tools people can actually use: **fast**, **clear**, and **straight to the point** — with **business impact always at the forefront**.

What I build is shaped by these ideas:

- 📊 Use Power BI for clarity — not clutter  
- 🧮 Let DAX do the heavy lifting behind the scenes  
- 🎨 Build custom visuals with Deneb when native charts can’t tell the full story  
- 🧠 Focus on cognitive simplicity — because if it takes more than 3 seconds to understand, it needs another pass

> I don’t want to master every tool. I want to master the experience — for the person on the other side of the dashboard.

This space is where I explore that work, piece by piece.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

### 🎯 Visual Simplicity with Maximum Impact

You don’t need every tool in the stack. Just:

- Power BI  
- Deneb (Vega-Lite)  
- Simple SVG logic  

That’s often 90% of what it takes to create branded, interactive, low-friction dashboards.

### 🤖 Staying Relevant in an AI-First World

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot can auto-generate charts and reports.  
But what they can’t replicate is:

- **Simple & Sophisticated**
- **Empathy**
- **User-first design approach**
- **Very Useful and Bang on Visuals that drive High Impact Business Decisions**

I design for human interpretation — not just machine output.

## 🧭 My Learning Path

1. **Power BI** — build clean dashboards and reports  
2. **DAX** — write logic that responds to context and goals  
3. **Deneb** — go custom when native visuals aren’t cutting it  
4. **D3.js** — deep customization and full visual control for edge cases (or monetization)
